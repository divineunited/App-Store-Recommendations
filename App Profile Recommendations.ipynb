Meaning the apps that this data analysis will be meant for are companies building applications that are free to download and free to use - generating revenue from advertisements.\n",

There's no use in including apps for non-English speakers in our data-set. one of the ways that we can do to check for non-native apps is by checking any apps that have non-anglicized characters in it by doing string indexing. The numbers corresponding to the characters we commonly use in an English text are all in the range 0 to 127, according to the ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange) system. Based on this number range, and using the built in [ord()](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#ord) function, we can build a function that detects whether a character belongs to the set of common English characters or not.\n",
