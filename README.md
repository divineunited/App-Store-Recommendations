# Profiles of Apps that are profitable in the App Store and Google Play Markets

*- Danny Vu*

The following project will attempt to analyze data to help App developers better understand what kinds of apps are likely to attract more users. The aim of this project is to find mobile apps that are profitable in the App Store AND the Google Play markets.

I am specifically focusing on apps that generate revenue via in-line advertisements and not through subscription or purchases. Meaning the apps that this data analysis will be meant for are companies building applications that are free to download and free to use - generating revenue from advertisements.

I'm also doing this project without the use of any non-built in Python modules - knowing that if I were indeed to do this with Pandas / Numpy, it might be easier. But we're going to do this project using purely built in Python data structures and simple algorithms.

## Summary of Results:
After looking through the data, we concluded that taking a popular book or book series and turning it into an app could be profitable for both the Google Play and the Apple Store markets.
